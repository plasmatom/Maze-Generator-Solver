# Maze Solver GUI

This Python application provides a graphical interface for solving mazes using various search algorithms.

## Overview

The application uses different search algorithms to find paths within a maze from a starting point to an endpoint. The available algorithms include:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)**
- **A\* Search (Astar)**

These algorithms are implemented through classes like `BFSearch`, `DFSearch`, `GBFSearch`, and `AstarSearch`. The application allows users to select and execute their preferred algorithm through the GUI's toolbar options.

## Installation

To run the application, ensure you have Python installed. Install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install PySide6
